    DESCRIPTION:

        This project is a simple Arduino-based robot arm that can be controlled via Bluetooth through an Android app.

    FILES:

        RobotArm.aia :
        Use this if you want to modify the Android app. 
        This can be modified with MIT App Inventor or Kodular (preferably Kodular).

        RobotArm.apk :
        This is the ready-to-install Android app to control the arm.

        RobotArm.ino :
        Use this if you want to calibrate or modify the robot arm's configurations.
        This can be modified with Arduino IDE (preferably).
